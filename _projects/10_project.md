## Overview
**Roles:** AR Development, VR Development, Design Generation  
**Skills:** Unity, Rhino3D/Grasshopper, C-Sharp   
**Time:** August - December 2021  
**Team:** 5 (MechE, CompSci, Design)/Individual   

VR/AR prototypes developed as part of COMPSCI294-137, Immersive Computing and Virtual Reality. 

## GeneratiVR
The goal of this work was to leverage the advantages of VR to explore a large-scale design space. To that end, we used the example of furniture (storage shelving) to demonstrate
different interactions that can allow users to better search through a design space. We developed a direct manipulation filter that allows users to specify the geometry of their preferred design, using
a virtual environment to reference scale, and a functionality filter that allows users to sort through designs based on the ability of the shelf to hold their desired items. This is a work in progress.
**This work was accepted as Late Breaking Work and presented at CHI 2022.**

## AR Game
This was a fun AR game I created in Unity based on the classic Whack-a-Mole game :)

## Reflection
VR/AR is an emerging technology that has a lot of potential, but also many challenges! I was surprised to see how quickly I was able to prototype some of the aspects of interactions in VR/AR. I can see both VR and AR being beneficial to designers and design processes given that they can allow more immersion.
