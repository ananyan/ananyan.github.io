## <u>Overview</u>
**My Role:** I contributed to this project by conducting several stakeholder interviews and leading the development of the prototype for NLP-based tagging and spatial mapping   
**Skills:** User Interviews, Natural Language Processing, Speech Recognition, Data Visualization, Python, Google Cloud API    
**Timeline:** January - May 2021    
**Team:** 5 (MechE, Cognitive Science, Data Science, Business)   

## <u>Goal</u>
For this project, we focused on improving information sharing for decision-makers in disaster response scenarios, working with NIWC Pacific.

## <u>Reflection</u>
It was interesting to work with NIWC on this project (as part of ME292C, Innovation in Disaster Response, Recovery, and Resilience) because they had a lot of domain expertise on the technical side, while we took a more user-centric approach to this complex problem. I think we were able to blend together both sides into our final prototypes, although it is likely that some of the problems such as latency and low-bandwidth in communication have to be solved by from the more technical side.
