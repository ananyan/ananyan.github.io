## Overview
**Roles:** Team Lead, Mechanical Design  
**Skills:** User Interviews, User Testing, CAD (Fusion 360), Material Selection  
**Time:** March 2019 (1 weekend)  
**Team:** 3 (MechE, AeroAstro, Chem) 

Developed as part ATHack 2019.

## The Problem
**The purpose of this project was to design a base to support our user's feet and allow him to be in a more seated position.**
   
This would increase the ease of transportation so that he would not have to be constantly lifted up and down by others to move around. 
At the same time, the platform would be removable, allowing our user, Julian, to stand within the gait trainer when desired. 
The platform was designed to attach to Julian's existing outdoor gait trainer with no permanent modifications to the frame.

## The Process
The challenge of this project was attaching to the existing frame, which was an unusual shape. In addition, we did not have 
constant access to the frame during prototyping. For this reason, the frame was rebuilt in CAD and the design was developed using 
the 3D model.

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/GaitTrainer/CadPlatform.jpg" alt = "Rendering of CAD for gait trainer with platform installed." class="img-fluid" %}
    </div>
</div>

In addition, in order to make sure the design was accessible, we tried to use off-the-shelf parts and minimize the use
of any special tools. A detailed description of the process can be found in this <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Removable-Platform-for-Gait-Trainer/" target="_blank">Instructable</a>.
 
## The Result
The photo below shows the final prototype of the removable platform.

We tested the platform with Julian, though testing was limited so we could not assure the durability of the prototype. The final prototype
was given to Julian.
