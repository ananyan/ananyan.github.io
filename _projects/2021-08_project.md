## <u>Context</u>
Similarity is a fundamental concept that helps humans make sense of the world around them, ranging from recognizing and categorizing objects, to conducting more complex tasks like analogical reasoning. Therefore, the way humans internally represent similarity can influence how they structure their ideas, knowledge, and even decisions. Aside from its relevance to cognition, capturing similarity is crucial for enabling large-scale search, informational retrieval, recommendation, or decision-support systems. For example, e-commerce websites try to recommend products that are similar to ones consumers have searched for and music streaming applications try to enhance playlists by adding similar songs. Quantifying similarity in the right way is challenging, but critical, for a multitude of applications, one of which is supporting creativity and ideation during early-stage design.   
## <u>Goal</u>
- Evaluate different similarity measures and how they impact product retrieval at a functional level
- Capture how humans perceive similarity between products at a functional level in comparison
- Understand how product similarity can be conveyed at a semantic level
