## Overview
**Roles:** Mold Design (3D Printed and Machined), Manufacturing (Injection-molded base)  
**Skills:** Design for Manufacturing, CAD (SolidWorks), CAM (MasterCAM), 3D Printing, CNC Milling, Injection Molding, Quality  
**Time:** September - December 2018  
**Team:** 5 (MechE) 

Developed as part of 2.008, Design & Manufacturing II.

## The Problem
**The goal of this project was to design a yo-yo for manufacturing at scale.**  

Due to a shared love of coffee shops, my team designed a yo-yo based on a latte. The yo-yo required a base with a fitted metal shim for weighting, a snap-fit between the "coffee" and the base, 
a fit between an injection molded "coffee" and the thermoformed part "foam", and a thermoformed "cup." 

## The Process
The yo-yo was first modeled using SolidWorks.

<img src="/images/Latte/Exploded.png" alt = "Exploded view of yoyo parts (cup, base piece, connector, shim, foam piece, coffee piece)." style="position:relative" >

This model was then used to design the molds. MasterCAM was used to create the toolpaths for creating the molds from aluminum and then the molds were made using
a CNC mill and a CNC lathe. A mold was 3D printed using an SLA printer for thermoforming the "foam."

<img src="/images/Latte/CoffeeMold.jpeg" alt = "Finished CNC milled mold for the coffee piece with a negative pattern for the latte art." style="position:relative" >

Test runs were conducted for all of the parts to optimize the process parameters and ensure the parts fit together as desired. The molds had to be 
modified a couple of times to improve the snap-fit. Finally, we did a production run and produced 100 of each part (50 of the cup) and assembled
50 yo-yos.

The full process is shown in the video below.

## The Result
The final yo-yo is shown with and without its "cup" below. The yo-yos were subject to a drop test to ensure that they did not fall apart.
