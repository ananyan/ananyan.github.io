Back from a wonderful Design Computing and Cognition â€˜22 in Glasgow, where our paper won the Best Paper Award in Design Cognition!


Pictured from left to right: Ashley Hartwell (MIT) with Best Design Computing Paper Award, me with Best Design Cognition/Neurocognition Paper Award, and Peter Rosso (Bristol) with Best Poster Award. This photo was taken at the conference dinner where we all happened to sit at the same table!
