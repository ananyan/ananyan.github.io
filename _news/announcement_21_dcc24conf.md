Back from my second Design Computing and Cognition â€˜24 in Montreal, Canada, where our paper, "Semantic properties of word prompts shape design outcomes: understanding the influence of semantic richness and similarity," won the Best Paper Award in Design Cognition/Neurocognition!

Now my first author work has won this award two conferences in a row! Since we didn't get physical awards, including the virtual announcement:
