Conversations with them revealed that while Julian could use the gait trainer to independently stand at times, his caregiver faced the challenge of having to constantly lift him up and down during transportation. Having a way to allow him to stand or be seated in his gait trainer would increase the ease of transportation (the trainer could be rolled with him in it). At the same time, a solution would need to allow him to stand within the gait trainer when desired.</p> <h2 id="goal"><u>Goal</u></h2> <p>Design a base to support Julian’s feet and allow him to be in a more seated position</p> <h2 id="outcomes"><u>Outcomes</u></h2> <p>1) Developed a removable platform, designed to attach to Julian’s existing outdoor gait trainer with no permanent modifications to the frame.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="w-50 p-3" style="margin:auto"> <figure> <picture> <source media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/GaitTrainer/Final-480.webp"></source> <source media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/GaitTrainer/Final-800.webp"></source> <source media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/GaitTrainer/Final-1400.webp"></source> <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/GaitTrainer/Final.jpg" alt="Final prototype of platform and attachment installed on Julian's gait trainer."> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>2) Tested the platform with Julian, though testing was limited so we could not assure the durability of the prototype (permission to include this video here was received from Julian’s family)</p> <div align="center"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cS5NEhcHEIk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </div> <p>3) Gave the final prototype to Julian and his family</p> <h2 id="design-process"><u>Design Process</u></h2> <p>The challenge of this project was attaching to the existing frame, which was an unusual shape. In addition, we did not have constant access to the frame during prototyping. For this reason, the frame was rebuilt in CAD and the design was developed using the 3D model.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/GaitTrainer/CAD-480.webp"></source> <source media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/GaitTrainer/CAD-800.webp"></source> <source media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/GaitTrainer/CAD-1400.webp"></source> <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/GaitTrainer/CAD.jpg" alt="Rendering of CAD for gait trainer with attachment to slide platform in."> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/GaitTrainer/CadPlatform-480.webp"></source> <source media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/GaitTrainer/CadPlatform-800.webp"></source> <source media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/GaitTrainer/CadPlatform-1400.webp"></source> <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/GaitTrainer/CadPlatform.jpg" alt="Rendering of CAD for gait trainer with platform installed."> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>In addition, in order to make sure the design was accessible, we tried to use off-the-shelf parts and minimize the use of any special tools. A detailed description of the process can be found in this <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Removable-Platform-for-Gait-Trainer/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">Instructable</a>.</p> <h2 id="reflection"><u>Reflection</u></h2> <p>This quick hackathon was a challenge because of the short amount of time we had to build our final solution, despite having some time ahead of time to work with Julian’s family to determine exactly what they needed and the challenges they were facing. Although we were able to come up with a relatively good solution, we could have made something of higher quality that would last longer given some more time. I think that this is a challenge of working with assistive technology since you want to deliver something that is useful to the people who you are working with, who are giving their valuable time and energy as well. However, it is not always possible to provide continued support or assistance with maintenance, which may lead to the hacked solution being discarded. Hopefully, Julian was able to use the platform at least for some amount of time!</p> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Ananya Nandy.
