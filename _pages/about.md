Hey there! I am currently a PhD student in the [Cognition and Computation in Design (Co-Design) Lab](https://codesign.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, advised by Kosa Goucher-Lambert. I have a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from MIT.
Currently, I work on research related to computation and human decision-making during the engineering design process.

Outside of research and work, you can find me reading fiction :blue_book:, searching for new coffee shops :coffee:, or trying out new recipes :curry:.
