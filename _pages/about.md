Hey there! I am currently a PhD student in the [Cognition and Computation in Design (Co-Design) Lab](https://codesign.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, advised by Kosa Goucher-Lambert.
I work on research related to computation and human decision-making during the engineering design process.

I have a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from MIT, where I worked on projects ranging from assistive technology to stretchable electronics.

Outside of research and work, you can find me reading, running, or trying out new recipes.
