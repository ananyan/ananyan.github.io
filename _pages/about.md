Hey there! I am currently a PhD candidate in the [Co-Design Lab](https://codesign.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, advised by Prof. Kosa Goucher-Lambert. 

My work primarily focuses on understanding cognitive and computational representations of design information, drawing from **design theory and methodology**, **cognitive science**, and **computer science**. Broadly, I'm interested in human-centered computing, particularly applied to complex, creative contexts. 

During my PhD, I have worked as a research intern in the Human-Centered AI Division at [TRI](https://www.tri.global/our-work/human-centered-ai). I have a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from MIT, where I worked on various human-centered design projects often focused on assistive technology and health. Outside of research and work, you can find me reading fiction :books: or searching for new coffee shops :coffee:.
