Hey there! I am currently a PhD candidate in the [Cognition and Computation in Design (Co-Design) Lab](https://codesign.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, advised by Kosa Goucher-Lambert. I have a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from MIT. 

I'm interested in human-centered computing for engineering design, specifically, developing models of human behavior during design processes, and finding computational methods for design that align with human representations of information. Broadly, this involves studying perception and decision making during complex, creative contexts, drawing from design theory and methodology (e.g., functional modeling, product semantics), cognitive science (e.g., analogy, similarity), and computer science (e.g., low-dimensional embeddings, preference learning, interactive interfaces).

Outside of research and work, you can find me reading fiction :books: or searching for new coffee shops :coffee:.
