Hey there! I am currently a PhD student in the [Cognition and Computation in Design (Co-Design) Lab](https://codesign.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, advised by Kosa Goucher-Lambert. I have a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from MIT. Through my research, I try to understand how humans represent and interact with different types of design information, with the goal of advancing human-centered computing in engineering design. Though I'm currently working on the fundamentals, I'm also actively working to apply my research to impactful problems such as those related to sustainable or inclusive design!

Outside of research and work, you can find me reading fiction :books:, searching for new coffee shops :coffee:, or trying out new recipes :curry:.
