Hey there! I am currently a PhD candidate in the [Cognition and Computation in Design (Co-Design) Lab](https://codesign.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, advised by Kosa Goucher-Lambert. I have a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from MIT. 

My work simultaneously involves developing better models of human behavior during design and developing computational interactions/methods for design that better align with human representations, with the goal of advancing human-centered computing in engineering design. **By capturing what people are doing during design, my aim is to help people more easily translate their ideas into reality across modalities, moving towards expanding the accessibility of design towards all populations.**

Outside of research and work, you can find me reading fiction :books:, searching for new coffee shops :coffee:, or trying out new recipes :curry:.
